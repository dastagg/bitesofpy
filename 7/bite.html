<p>In this bite we will look at <a href="http://bit.ly/2AKSIbf" target="_blank">this small server log</a> finding the first and last <i>Shutdown initiated</i> events and calculate the time between the two events.</p><p>In order to do this you need to extract the timestamps from the log entries and convert them to <code>datetime</code> objects. You can then use <code>datetime.timedelta</code> to calculate time differences between them. Check out the docstrings and the <i>TESTS</i> for more info.</p><p>Good luck and have fun!</p><p><small><strong>Update 4th of Apr 2018: </strong>we slightly updated the Bite to make it a bit more intuitive. We removed the requirement to read in the file. If you already started this Bite and the tests break, click on LAST SAVES -> START OVER to load in the new template code.</small></p>
